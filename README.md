A short video on my project:

My project is called Block Conqueror and I was attending to create a Fire Emblem/Vanguard Bandit styled game, since I enjoyed them and it is a shame those type of game isn't popular and I wanted to re-create a game I enjoy. I felt like I was overambitous before the creation of the project, and the game is more complex then I expected and there are no similiar tutorial or inspiration for this type of game. It was still an enjoyable experiment coding a game for the first time

main.py file will contain my code for this project and it will be under "Main" folder.
The sources I used are open sourced and it will be listed on the bottom. 

Diffuculties:
Pygame is not extremly diffucult to use, but learning all the functions was time consuming and it is a requirement to learn those imported functions instead of simply using the code

One of my main problem when creating the game is learning how to incorporate sprites and many of the online tutorials does'nt have the exact information I was looking for. For the map and background I used Tiled which converted the sprites into TMX and TSX files, and learning how to utilize those files consume a signigficant amount of time. I utilized some codes in the video linked on how to use those files: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6xqCwblyiw

The main diffuculty I encountered was the sprite sheet I used. Since I wasnt considering using the animation I cut the animations into even pieces and blit it on my game, but the problem was the images wasn't 64x64 (my black size), even though it fits on a block it wasnt aligned with my attended location due to the dead space of the image. I continued on coding thinking it is a minor bug, by the time I worked through a major portion of my program I realized I have to redo almost the whole thing.
