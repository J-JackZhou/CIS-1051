# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The project will ressemblence Fire Emblem//Vanguard Bandit. The game will be a 2D top down view turned base game. There will be a main boss that need to be defeated inorder to win the game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be using PyGame to create my game. I will use sprites from creative content to help create my project. Each chracter will have HP (health) and Mana (energy). If any chracter or opponent HP drops to zero it will be removed from the map. The game will be in a grid like map, where moving far in the grid will use up more energy, which in turn will cause the player to have less energy to perform certain attacks and spells, which will also require mana. I will decide the cooldown period for mana to regenerate. The boss will have boosted stat line and have special attack animations. For the maps I will try and create a grid using certain keys and try and assign specific key to one of the sprite animation. For the AI//Opponent I will have the non-boss chracters go to where ever the players chracter is at, and using as much energy as possible, therefore still giving a player an edge, since I will have the minion with similiar statline as the player's chracter. I will make if statements so depending on where the character is at inposition to the opposing character will add buff to the statline (example behind the opponent will deal more damage) If time permits I will add elements such as fog of war where the player cant see the opponent if they're behind a tree. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will try and accomplish finishing the map utilizing sprites, creating the movement aspect of the chracters, the AI opponents, and the different attack moves.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I might be able to implement terrains, multiple skills and moves for each chracter. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best possible I am looking for is to create a final boss, with special animations and moves, so it can give a sense of special feeling. I think the most complex aspect is creating a perfect AI//opponent health, and attack ratio where the game will not feel impossible to beat, and not too easy where the game is pointless.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step is to do research on all the major features pygame provides. I will learn how to implement photos into programming. So far in my learning all the user inputs have been typing words and pressing enter, so I will need to figure out how to inmplent keyboard keys as an input without pressing "enter" everytime. I believe alot of math will be needed inorder to create the ratio of attack, health, and mana, which I will need to figure out a formula to have a balance stat for every chracter. I will need to learn how to run my code and implement it as an actaul software.
