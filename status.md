Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far in my project alot of the learning the basics of pygame was really time consuming, but I so far initialized the game, created the maps and tiles, impemented the characters and the sprites. I have all the static components done. Doesnt seem like much, but I am confident that the remainder of my project will be a smoother sail, and that intial learning was the most diffucult part.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

So far I added all of the elements of the game, but I have not implemented any actual game play. I feel like I have done the hard part and now I will just have to implement the game tactics and the actual game play. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I do not think I have any major problem implementing my ideas, I just intially underestimated the time I will need to learn the basic of pygame. Alot of my earlier problems was having problems with installing pip and adding pygames, and most of the online guides and tutorials are made for windows computer. There aren't that much online tutorails for the type of game that I am making, so it is diffucult to find inspiration and guide, so I had to dig through the pygame library for information I need.
